# 🛠️ Drive Formatting & Certificate Fixes - v2.1

## 🔧 Issues Fixed:

### 1. **Drive Visibility After Formatting**
**Problem**: Formatted drives were not visible in File Explorer after the wipe operation.

**Root Cause**: 
- Drives were being cleaned but not properly assigned drive letters
- Windows Explorer wasn't being refreshed to show the changes
- Diskpart commands were incomplete

**Solution Implemented**:
✅ **Enhanced Diskpart Script**: Now includes proper partition creation, activation, labeling, and drive letter assignment
✅ **Windows Explorer Refresh**: Automatically refreshes the system to make drives visible
✅ **Drive Detection**: Added functions to detect newly formatted drives by volume label
✅ **Better Error Reporting**: Shows diskpart command output and any errors

### 2. **Certificate Placement**
**Problem**: Certificates were always saved to the application directory instead of the formatted drive.

**Solution Implemented**:
✅ **Smart Certificate Placement**: Certificates are now saved directly to the formatted drive when possible
✅ **Fallback Mechanism**: If the formatted drive isn't accessible, saves to application directory with clear indication
✅ **Clear Feedback**: Shows exactly where the certificate was saved in both the log and success message

## 🚀 New Features in v2.1:

### **Enhanced Diskpart Operations**:
```
select disk {index}
clean
create partition primary
active
format fs=ntfs quick label="WIPED_DRIVE"
assign
exit
```

### **Automatic Drive Detection**:
- Scans for drives with "WIPED_DRIVE" label
- Uses both Win32 API and fallback methods for compatibility
- Waits for drive to be recognized by the system

### **Windows Explorer Integration**:
- Sends system broadcast messages to refresh File Explorer
- Ensures newly formatted drives appear immediately
- Works with both logical and physical drives

### **Improved Certificate Details**:
- Shows where certificate was saved (drive vs. application directory)
- Enhanced certificate content with verification information
- Better error handling if certificate generation fails

## 📋 What Happens Now:

### **For Physical/Raw Drives**:
1. 🔄 Secure wipe operations (overwrite files, delete, free space wipe)
2. 🛠️ **Enhanced diskpart**: Clean, create partition, format with label "WIPED_DRIVE", assign drive letter
3. 🔄 **Windows Explorer refresh**: Make drive visible in File Explorer
4. 🔍 **Drive detection**: Find the newly formatted drive by label
5. 📄 **Certificate placement**: Save certificate directly to the formatted drive

### **For Logical Drives**:
1. 🔄 Secure wipe operations (overwrite files, delete, free space wipe)
2. 🛠️ **Enhanced format**: Format with volume label "WIPED_DRIVE"
3. 🔄 **Windows Explorer refresh**: Refresh system to show changes
4. 📄 **Certificate placement**: Save certificate to the formatted drive

## 🎯 Expected Results:

### **After Formatting**:
- ✅ Drive appears in File Explorer immediately
- ✅ Drive has label "WIPED_DRIVE"
- ✅ Drive is properly formatted with NTFS
- ✅ Certificate is saved ON the formatted drive (not just in app directory)

### **Certificate Location**:
- **Primary**: `{DriveLabel}:\CodeMonk_SecureCertificate_{timestamp}.pdf`
- **Fallback**: `Application Directory\CodeMonk_SecureCertificate_{timestamp}.pdf`

## 🔍 Troubleshooting:

If drives still don't appear:
1. **Run as Administrator** (required for diskpart operations)
2. **Check Windows Disk Management** (`diskmgmt.msc`) - drive should appear there
3. **Manual refresh**: Press F5 in File Explorer or restart it
4. **Check the log**: Application now shows detailed diskpart output

## 🚀 Ready to Test:

The updated executable `dist\CodeMonk_SecureFormatter.exe` now includes:
- ✅ Proper drive formatting with immediate visibility
- ✅ Certificate saved directly to the formatted drive
- ✅ Enhanced error reporting and feedback
- ✅ Windows Explorer auto-refresh functionality

**Test it on a disposable USB drive or test partition first!**
