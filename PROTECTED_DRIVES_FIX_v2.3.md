# PROTECTED DRIVES FIX v2.3 - Live OS/Fedora USB Support

## Problem Identified
Your Fedora Live USB has protected/read-only files and filesystems that can't be modified through normal file operations. The error showed:
- **Permission denied** deleting LiveOS files (even as admin)
- **No space left on device** during overwrite operations
- Drive remaining intact after "secure wipe"

## Root Cause Analysis
- **Live OS Protection**: Fedora Live USB has protected boot files and read-only filesystems
- **Insufficient Approach**: File-level operations can't handle protected/mounted filesystems
- **Space Limitations**: Large random writes failed due to insufficient free space

## New Solution: Direct Diskpart Approach
The application now **skips problematic file operations** for protected drives and goes **straight to low-level diskpart formatting**:

### What's Changed:
1. **Skip File Overwriting**: No longer attempts to overwrite protected files
2. **Skip File Deletion**: No longer tries to delete read-only system files  
3. **Skip Free Space Wiping**: No longer fills drive with random data
4. **Enhanced Diskpart**: More robust diskpart script with better error handling
5. **Extended Timeout**: 10-minute timeout for protected drive operations

### New Process Flow:
```
1. Detect protected/Live OS drive
2. Skip file-level operations (prevents permission errors)
3. Run enhanced diskpart with:
   - select disk {number}
   - clean (wipes all partitions and data)
   - create partition primary
   - active
   - format fs=ntfs quick label="WIPED_DRIVE"  
   - assign (gives it a drive letter)
4. Refresh Windows Explorer
5. Generate certificate to formatted drive
```

## How to Use the Updated Version

### Step 1: Run as Administrator
```
Right-click CodeMonk_SecureFormatter.exe → "Run as administrator"
```

### Step 2: Expected Behavior
- Application detects it's a protected drive
- Shows: "Protected/Live OS detected - using diskpart for complete drive wipe"
- Skips file operations (no more permission errors)
- Runs diskpart to completely wipe and reformat the drive
- Drive appears as "WIPED_DRIVE" in Explorer

### Step 3: Success Indicators
- ✅ No permission denied errors
- ✅ Diskpart completes successfully  
- ✅ Drive shows as "WIPED_DRIVE" in Explorer
- ✅ Certificate saved to the wiped drive
- ✅ All data completely destroyed

## Testing the Fix
1. **BACKUP** any important data from the Fedora USB first
2. Run the new `dist\CodeMonk_SecureFormatter.exe` as Administrator
3. Select your Fedora Live USB drive  
4. Start the wipe operation
5. Watch for "Protected/Live OS detected" message
6. Operation should complete without permission errors
7. Drive should appear as "WIPED_DRIVE" with certificate

## Technical Details
- **Diskpart Clean**: Removes all partition information and data
- **Protected Drive Detection**: Automatically handles Live OS and read-only drives
- **No File Operations**: Bypasses problematic file-level security
- **Low-Level Formatting**: Creates fresh NTFS partition from scratch
- **Extended Timeout**: Handles slow protected drive operations

## Files Changed
- `secure_wipe.py` - Rewritten to skip file operations for protected drives
- Enhanced diskpart with better error handling and timeout
- Improved status messages and error reporting

## Version Info
- **Version**: 2.3
- **Fix**: Protected Drives (Live OS/Fedora USB)  
- **Date**: August 30, 2025
